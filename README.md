Unique Group Name: Tech-Elites_2.5

Group: 2

Project Topic Name/Title: POVERTY ERADICATION.


SDG Goal: Our project is based on the Sustainable Development Goal 1, which
is “No Poverty”.

❖ The Goal is to ensure the Eradication of poverty at least by half, by 2030,
by engaging men, women and children living in poverty in all its
dimensions by the national standard .

❖ Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures
for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the
poor and the vulnerable

❖ It aims at targeting the most vulnerable, increasing basic resources and
services and supporting communities affected by conflict and
climate-related disasters.


Description:
Significant step towards prioritising “Eradication of poverty” globally will bring
about progressive change for the better. 
This change will just be the beginning of the global movement, with the poor in every country getting the basic equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources,
appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.

❖ Create an NGO website that prioritises eradication of poverty by ensuring
that the poor in our society have basic access to economic resources.

❖ Create a blog page that inspires readers and turns all readers into a
philanthropist to donate towards poverty eradication in the society.

❖ Fund-Raising campaigns will be a periodic exercise and will be managed
in the events page.

❖ There will be a volunteer section for all that wishes to participate in any
capacity at all.

❖ A form will be created for the volunteer to ensure that only people that are
credible will be participating in the area of fund management.


WHY POVERTY ERADICATION:
Well, it is a positive way to bring about equality in the society, maintain
economic growth and encourage paying it forward or giving back to the society.
